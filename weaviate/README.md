# Multi-Modal Text/Image search using CLIP

![Weaviate Multi-Modal Search](./weaviate-multi-modal-clip-search-demo.png)

This example application spins up a Weaviate instance using the
[multi2vec-clip](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/modules/multi2vec-clip.html)
module, imports a few sample images (you can add your own images, too!) and
provides a very simple search frontend in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using
the [Weaviate JS Client
](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/client-libraries/javascript.html)

It is a minimal example using only 5 images, but you can add any amount of
images yourself!

## Prerequisites to run it yourself
- Docker & Docker-Compose
- Bash
- Node.js and npm/yarn if you also want to run the frontend

## Run it yourself

1. Start up Weaviate using `docker-compose up -d`
2. Import the schema (the script will wait for Weaviate to be ready) using `bash ./import/curl/create_schema.sh`
3. Import the images using `bash ./import/curl/import.sh`
4. To run the frontend navigate to the `./frontend` folder and run `yarn && yarn start`. Wait for your browser to open at `http://localhost:3000`

## How to run with your own images

Simply add your images to the `./images` folder prior to running the import
script. The script looks for `.jpg` file ending, but Weaviate supports other
image types as well, you can adopt those if you like.

This demo uses the [ckip-ViT-B32-multilingual-v1](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32-multilingual-v1) model from [SBERT.net](https://sbert.net). Shoutout to Nils Reimers and his colleagues for the great Sentence Transformers models.
